      <span class="choiceItem description">So you wanna be a shopkeep? You'll be tasked with the painful ordeal of dealing with heroes daily, and finding some magical item to sell them. Not that it has to be magical, heroes are tired and weary when they arrive at your shop, and (just saying) that broom handle that broke a few weeks ago kinda looks like a special?<br><br>
      If you pick shopkeep (by clicking the big blue word shopkeep) you'll get to submit items which other heroes can pick up from your shop. The hero's job is to figure out how they use your item to defeat whatever evil awaits them. They get to pick the evil, so be creative. Once someone chooses your item, the response will be shown. Just FYI, this isn't a real choice. You can switch at any time, and I encourage you to do a bit of hero-ing too!

      <span class="choiceHero description">So you wanna be a hero? Tired and overworked, you're bound to stumble into a shop at some point, having lost all your equipment. Disappointed by the selection of items available the surprisingly persuasive shopkeep absolutely sells you on the weapon for your next quest. You set off, thankful to leave, but worried about how inappropriate your weapon might be for the trials to come. As you enter the final stages of the dungeon (metaphorical or physical) you discover how perfectly the shopkeep's item is for the situation. Just how does it help you?<br><br>
      If you pick hero (by clicking the big pink word hero) you'll get to respond to shopkeep's item submissions by describing how you are victorious with it! The shopkeep's job is to submit items, and you'll be able to pick any from a list that look interesting. Just FYI, this isn't a real choice. You can switch at any time, and I encourage you to do a bit of salesmanship too!</span>
